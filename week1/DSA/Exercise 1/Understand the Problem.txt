Why Data Structures and Algorithms are Essential in Handling Large Inventories
Data structures and algorithms are crucial in handling large inventories because they determine how efficiently data can be stored, retrieved, and manipulated. In an inventory management system, you need to perform operations like adding new products, updating product details, and deleting products. Efficient data structures ensure that these operations are performed quickly and use minimal resources, which is essential when dealing with large datasets.

Types of Data Structures Suitable for Inventory Management
ArrayList: Suitable for maintaining an ordered list of items, allowing fast access by index but slower insertion and deletion operations.
HashMap: Provides average O(1) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, making it ideal for situations where quick access to items by a unique key (such as productId) is required.
