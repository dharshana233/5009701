Understand Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
Description: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the average and worst case, O(n) in the best case when the list is already sorted.
Insertion Sort
Description: Builds the sorted list one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position among the already sorted elements.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the average and worst case, O(n) in the best case when the list is already sorted.
Quick Sort
Description: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two subarrays, one with elements less than the pivot and the other with elements greater than the pivot. The process is then recursively applied to the subarrays.
Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average, O(n^2) in the worst case when the pivot selection is poor.
Merge Sort
Description: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in all cases (best, average, and worst).
