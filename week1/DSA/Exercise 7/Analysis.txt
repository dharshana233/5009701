Analysis
Time Complexity
The time complexity of the recursive algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of years. Each call to predictFutureValue decreases the years by one, leading to n recursive calls.
Optimization
Memoization: Store the results of previously computed subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. This technique transforms the recursive solution into a dynamic programming approach, reducing the time complexity.
