Understand Linked Lists
Types of Linked Lists
Singly Linked List:

Structure: Consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
Advantages: Simplicity and lower memory usage compared to doubly linked lists.
Disadvantages: Only allows traversal in one direction and does not allow direct access to previous nodes.
Doubly Linked List:

Structure: Each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
Advantages: Allows traversal in both directions and more efficient operations such as insertion and deletion of nodes.
Disadvantages: Increased memory usage due to storing an extra reference (previous node).
