Analysis
Time Complexity
Linear Search:

Worst Case: O(n) - When the element is at the end of the list or not present.
Average Case: O(n) - On average, about half of the list needs to be checked.
Best Case: O(1) - When the element is at the beginning of the list.
Binary Search:

Worst Case: O(log n) - The list is divided in half each time, leading to a logarithmic number of steps.
Average Case: O(log n) - On average, it performs in logarithmic time.
Best Case: O(1) - When the element is at the middle of the list initially.
When to Use Each Algorithm
Linear Search:

Suitable for small datasets or when the data is unsorted.
Useful when the overhead of sorting is not justified.
Binary Search:

Suitable for large datasets where the data is sorted.
Provides significantly faster search times for sorted lists due to its logarithmic time complexity.
Sorting overhead is justified for datasets with frequent searches.
